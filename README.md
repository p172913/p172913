Associate Software Engineer with 3 years of experience building scalable, cloud-native applications using Typescript, Spring Boot, Kubernetes, and AWS. Passionate about backend development, infrastructure automation, and observability.

I’ve led projects optimizing REST APIs, automating OWASP scans, and building AWS-based CI/CD pipelines with Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes — significantly reducing manual effort and deployment times.

Outside of work, I regularly upskill through advanced AI, DevOps, and cloud courses, and enjoy participating in coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef, and HackerRank.
